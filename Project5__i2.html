                <p>You crack your knuckles, ready to focus on that all-important document.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, you have the urge to check your inbox. Reorganizing your Trello seems strangely appealing.
                    There's even a siren song emanating from your laundry basket, enticing you to humdrum household
                    chores...</p>
                <p>Left untamed, procrastination is destructive. Indeed, <span>regular procrastination impairs your
                        career growth and impacts your mental health.</span></p>
                <p>Yet many of the world's most creative people procrastinate (case in point: <span>Victor Hugo).
                        Procrastination is associated with impulsiveness, and impulsiveness is directly linked to
                        creativity</span>!
                </p>
                <p>By harnessing procrastination, you can become even more productive. Here's how...</p>
                <h5>The war inside your brain</h5>
                <p>Knowing you should do one thing, while being helplessly drawn to another, is an age-old malaise.
                    Ancient Greek philosophers described it as <span>akrasia, acting against your better
                        judgment.</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Your prefrontal cortex. This governs executive function: your goals,
                            values, and ability to make complex strategic choices.

                            Example: Quarterly planning demands tough conversations and
                            uncomfortable trade-offs- but getting it right can change your trajectory.
                            Your prefrontal cortex helps you prioritize quarterly planning, weighing its
                            temporary discomfort against the long-term benefits.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Your limbic system. This is your primordial pleasure center, or "lizard
                            brain": it's short-termist, and always prioritizes your physical and mental
                            comfort.

                            Example: You try to focus on quarterly planning, but your eyes glaze over.
                            Your limbic system is kicking in, you're itching for a gratifying rush of
                            dopamine... hmm, maybe I'll make some edits to my next blog post!😊</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Of course, the pleasures of procrastination are short-lived and unsatisfying. <span>Tim Urban
                        describes
                        this as the "dark playground"</span>--when the relief is
                    tarnished by guilt.
                </p>
                <p>When procrastination beckons, how do you respond? First, identify whether
                    this is <span>passive or active procrastination they have radically different
                        outcomes.</span></p>
                <h5>The 2 types of procrastination</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Passive procrastination. If your primary impulse is to withdraw from the task, you are
                            passively procrastinating.</p>
                        <p>
                            Diagnosis: You feel hesitant and indecisive, bargaining with yourself about when and how to
                            complete the task. Cue anxiety, scrolling through Twitter, and potentially missing your
                            deadline..</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Active procrastination. If your primary impulse is to redirect your energy elsewhere, you are
                            actively procrastinating.</p>
                        <p>
                            Diagnosis: You feel energized and purposeful, but can't bring yourself to complete the task.
                            So you leap into another project with gusto - you'll get back to the original task later,
                            right?</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>You might actively procrastinate over one task, and passively procrastinate over another. How can you
                    optimize your productivity in each case?</p>
                <h5>Passive procrastination</h5>
                <p>The brain's reward-based learning system has 3 components: <span>trigger,
                        behaviour, and reward</span>:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>When you passively procrastinate, the <strong>trigger</strong> is your feeling of discomfort
                        - perhaps your anticipation of the difficulty or tedium of completing a
                        task.</li>
                    <li>Your limbic system steers you to a <strong>behavior</strong> that's easy and comforting
                        like browsing YouTube, or making another coffee.</li>
                    <li>Your <strong>reward</strong> is a fleeting dopamine rush-until you remember your task's
                        fast-approaching deadline.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When we yield to our limbic system's pursuit of pleasure, we reinforce this
                    loop. That means we're more likely to procrastinate in the future.</p>
                <h6>The technique: Summon mindful curiosity to reframe your reward.</h6>
                <p><span>Mindfullness reduces procrastination.</span> So acknowledge the trigger, consider
                    your craving, then reframe the reward.</p>
                <p>Visualize the reward of procrastinating: momentary amusement or distraction,
                    followed by guilt. Then visualize the reward of completing the task:
                    satisfaction, and a feeling of progress.</p>
                <p>With practice, procrastination's guilty pleasures will shine less brightly. You
                    can then focus on the greater reward: completing the challenging task!</p>
                <h5>Active Procrastination</h5>
                <p>What about active procrastination, where you feel energized but your brain simply won't focus on your
                    intended task?</p>
                <p>Perhaps you need additional time to ruminate, or you're delaying because you work more effectively
                    under pressure. This is <span>strategic procrastination</span>, and it's easy to optimize.
                </p>
                <h6>The technique: Allow yourself a period of time-boxed procrastination.</h6>
                <p><span>Procrastinating before a task encourages divergent thinking</span>, which leads to your most
                    creative ideas. So when your mind bolts from a task, let it break free! Take a walk outside, indulge
                    in social media, or peruse a favorite publication-just set a time you'll return to your task, and
                    stick to it.</p>
                <p>Similarly, <span>unplugged vacations inspire creativity</span>-time them strategically, before your
                    biggest decisions. When you come back, you might just unlock your best ideas...</p>
